#Raspberry Cook#

##The history##


Raspberry Cook is a project started near september 2015. The first idea was simple: try to build a web-application without knowing. To make it more funny, I want to build it on a Raspberry Pi B+.

So I asked my girlfriend:

>"Hey! Want do you want a cool website?"

>"Yes, I want! To save all my recipes to cook."

>"Say no more!"


So for me purposes was very clear:
	* make a beautifull design
	* built it on my great Raspberry Pi B+
	* make a cleaner code and learn more & more technology to improve it

And I start to learn PHP / SQL / HTML / CCS on my Linux Mint laptop. I buy a Raspberry PI for some euro. I start to learn all SSH commands and to build a Apache Server. And I did all my best

When I was happy of my work. I broke all result to convert it into Ruby On Rails Framework to have the greatest website on hearth, of course !!
