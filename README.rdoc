<h1>Raspberry Cook</h1>

<h2>The history</h2>


<p>Raspberry Cook is a project started near september 2015. The first idea was simple: try to build a web-application without knowing. To make it more funny, I want to build it on a Raspberry Pi B+.</p>

<p>So I asked my girlfriend:
<ul>
	<li>Hey! Want do you want a cool website?</li>
	<li>Yes, I want! To save all my recipes to cook.</li>
	<li>Say no more!</li>
</ul></p>

<p>So for me purposes was very clear:
<ol>
	<li>make a beautifull design</li>
	<li>built it on my great Raspberry Pi B+</li>
	<li>make a cleaner code and learn more & more technology to improve it</li>
</ol></p>

<p>And I start to learn <code>PHP / SQL / HTML / CCS</code> on my Linux Mint laptop. I buy a Raspberry PI for some euro. I start to learn all SSH commands and to build a Apache Server. And I did all my best</p>

<p>When I was happy of my work. I broke all result to convert it into Ruby On Rails Framework to have the greatest website on hearth, of course !!</p>
